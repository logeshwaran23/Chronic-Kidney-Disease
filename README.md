Algorithms Used:

XGBoost: XGBoost is a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm known for its scalability and performance in various machine learning tasks. It's particularly suitable for classification problems like predicting chronic kidney disease.

Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges them together to get more accurate and stable predictions. It's widely used for classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
Best Accuracy Model:
The model with the highest accuracy on the validation/test dataset is chosen as the best accuracy model for predicting chronic kidney disease. The selection is based on rigorous evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and reliability of the chosen model.
